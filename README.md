# binary tree

thinking about how I could replace the simple array in [gavel](https://github.com/sjmarshy/gavel) with a sorted binary 
tree - that seems like it might be more appropriate.

IDK though, so I was just playing around with the concept. 

I'd like to make it properly functional, still relying on mutation here but I currently have no ideas about how to do it
in a non-mutative way. Huh
